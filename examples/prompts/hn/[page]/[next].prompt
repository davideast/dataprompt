Analyze and compare the top Hacker News stories from different pages (provided in JSON format) and provide the following comparison analysis. Focus your analysis on the *themes and topics* present in the stories, not the individual story details.

1. **Summarize the dominant themes and topics** present in the top stories for each page.  Be concise (a short paragraph for each page).

2. **Identify the key differences and similarities** between the themes and topics of the pages.  Again, be concise (a short paragraph for each).

3. **Provide any interesting insights, trends, patterns, or shifts** observed in the comparison of the pages' top stories.  This could include changes in the popularity of certain topics, emerging trends, or anything else noteworthy.

4. **Identify the most prominent themes shared by each page.**

5. **Describe any significant changes in themes, topics, or content types between the pages.**  For each significant change, briefly describe the change (e.g., "Increased focus on LLM model capability").
